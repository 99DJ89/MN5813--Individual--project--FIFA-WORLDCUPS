    "The Olympic Games immediately bring to mind powerful images of grandeur, excellence, internationalism, and history. For more than a millennium, from approximately 776 BC to about 400 AD, the ancient Olympics served as a powerful cultural institution in Greece. Within this immense history, truly unique accomplishments occurred, such as the astounding feat achieved by the runner Polites of Caria in 69 AD. Polites accomplished the nearly incredible challenge of winning both the shortest sprint, the stade (about 200 meters), and the long distance race on the same day. This demonstration of versatility was considered a \"great marvel\" in antiquity by Pausanias, and no athlete in the ancient or modern eras has ever equaled this particular double victory. Modern coaches believe long and short distances require wholly different training, muscle fibers, and techniques.\n",
    "It is appropriate to compare ancient and modern competitors, as our contemporary athletic system is the only one in world history that is substantially similar to the Greeks’ system, having borrowed heavily from it. However, the terminology itself requires clarification. The popular phrase “Olympic Games” is considered a bad mistranslation. The correct Greek term, Olympiakoi agones, does not translate to \"games\" or \"play,\" but rather to “struggles” or “contests,” which is the root of the English word “agony”. Greek athletics were focused on individual contests and were not considered recreational \"sport\" or diversionary festivals.\n",
    "Furthermore, historical research into the ancient games reveals that the concept of amateurism was not practiced by the ancient Greeks, despite the insistence of figures like Avery Brundage in the modern era. The modern revival itself—specifically track and field—arose from a conscious imitation of ancient Greek practices, promoted by early revivals in Britain and modern Greece beginning as early as 1859. This history aims to provide an accessible and comprehensive look at these ancient competitions and their influence on the world.\n",
    "# Aim:\n",
    "The goal is to find historical patterns and insights in the Olympic athletes dataset, with a focus on demographics, how countries perform, and how medals are distributed across different sports.\n",
    "# Objectives:\n",
    "- Start by cleaning and preparing the Olympic dataset so it is ready for analysis.\n",
    "- Look into the demographics of the athletes and see how participation has changed over time.\n",
    "- Analyze how medals are distributed by country, sport, and gender.\n",
    "- Visualize key findings with charts.\n",
    "- Summarize what was learned and talk about any possible limitations"
